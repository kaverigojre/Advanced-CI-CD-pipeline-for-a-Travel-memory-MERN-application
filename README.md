Advanced CI/CD pipeline for a Travel memory MERN application

Design a solution to manage the lifecycle of a decoupled MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) (Travel memory app) application by establishing separate workflows for the frontend and backend components.

Implement a branching strategy with main (production) and develop (development) branches. 

Introduce distinct staging environments (staging-frontend and staging-backend branches) for independent testing and deployment of frontend and backend.

The primary objectives include automating testing, enabling continuous integration, and ensuring seamless deployment to staging and production environments for both frontend and backend components. Additionally, set up manual deployment workflows, implement pull request checks, and thoroughly document the CI/CD processes for contributors.
